# Password Manager v2

A simple yet effective password manager tool built with Python that securely stores your passwords along with associated contact information. This is version 2 of the project, upgraded from plain text file storage to a persistent database using Pythonâ€™s built-in `shelve` module for better data management and reliability.

## Features

- Store multiple password entries for different apps/websites.
- Save associated contact information (email, phone, username).
- Timestamp each password entry with the date and time saved.
- Search passwords by app or website name.
- Display all saved passwords in a readable format.
- Easy-to-use command-line interface with clear options.
- Handles data storage reliably with `shelve` for persistent key-value storage.

## Why Version 2?

The original version used plain text files to save passwords, which led to:

- Difficulties in managing and searching data.
- Risk of data corruption during file read/write.
- Limited scalability as the data grew.

This version leverages `shelve` to act like a persistent dictionary, storing app names as keys and lists of password entries as values. This structure makes data retrieval and updates seamless and robust.

## Code Overview

* **save(app, contact, password)**: Saves password info with timestamp for a given app.
* **search(app)**: Retrieves all saved entries for the specified app.
* **debug\_show\_all()**: Lists all saved passwords for all apps.
* Data is stored persistently in a `shelve` database file named `Manager`.

---

## Future Improvements

* Add encryption to store passwords securely.
* Implement delete/update functionality for entries.
* Build a graphical user interface (GUI) for better usability.
* Explore integration with password generators.
* Migrate to a more advanced database for scalability (e.g., SQLite).
